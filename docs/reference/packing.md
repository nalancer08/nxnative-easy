## Build tools

### Homebrew .NET is on PATH but apphosts cannot find the runtime

- **Symptom:** the first extraction stops with `nx_extract exit code 131` and `.NET location: Not found`, even though `dotnet` is on `PATH`. The shader translator can fail the same way.
- **Cause:** standalone .NET apphosts search runtime roots and registered installations, not `PATH` ([.NET runtime discovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables#dotnet_root-dotnet_rootx86-dotnet_root_x86-dotnet_root_x64)). Homebrew's formula installs the runtime under `libexec` and its `bin/dotnet` can be a wrapper that sets `DOTNET_ROOT` only for its own child ([Homebrew caveat](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/dotnet)). Resolving that wrapper's symlink gives `bin`, not the runtime root.
- **Fix:** `scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py` `configure_dotnet` derives the root from the `Microsoft.NETCore.App` entry in `dotnet --list-runtimes`, using the build's environment, before any extraction or survey. It exports `DOTNET_ROOT` both to that environment and to `os.environ`, for tools launched with an explicit environment and those that inherit it. Caller-supplied roots, including architecture-specific overrides, retain precedence. A failed or malformed probe leaves the environment unchanged rather than guessing the wrapper's directory.
- **Found on:** [Balatro](../../dm/games/0100CD801CE5E000/README.md), first extraction with Homebrew .NET ([PR #284](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/pull/284)). Applies to every game's build on that installation setup.

## Compressed inputs

### NSZ decompression rejects `--keys`

- **Symptom:** `decompress NSZ` stops immediately with `nsz: error: unrecognized arguments: --keys …`.
- **Cause:** `nsz` 4.6.1 has no `--keys` argument. It loads `keys.txt` beside `sys.argv[0]`, or falls back to `~/.switch/prod.keys`, while importing its modules, before parsing arguments ([4.6.1 key loader](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz/blob/4.6.1/nsz/nut/Keys.py)). Newer upstream code supports `--keys`; staging `keys.txt` also supports 4.6.1.
- **Fix:** `scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py` `decompress_nsz` links the file selected by `-k` as `keys.txt` in the conversion's temporary folder and runs `nsz -D` there, with `sys.argv[0]` set to `nsz` before import. Input and output paths are absolute. The temporary folder and link are removed on success or failure; the user's default keys are untouched.
- **Found on:** [Super Mario Odyssey](../../dm/games/0100000000010000/README.md), converting its v0 NSZ. Applies to NSZ and XCZ inputs for every game.

## Desktop build worker

### Prepare game fails at `os.setsid()`

- **Symptom:** clicking Prepare game stops before any build tools start, with `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted` at `build_session.py` `os.setsid()`.
- **Cause:** Foundation `Process` already launches the worker as its own process-group leader on macOS. POSIX rejects `setsid()` for a group leader. A normal Python subprocess launch did not expose this difference, so the original regression test missed the GUI path.
- **Fix:** reuse the existing group when `os.getpgrp() == os.getpid()`; call `setsid()` only for a worker that still shares its parent's group. Cancellation still signals the worker's separate group. Do not suppress unrelated permission failures. Added regression coverage for Foundation `Process`, an existing group leader, an existing session leader and a normal subprocess launch, including cancellation.
- **Found on:** a user's clean desktop installation, before game detection; reproduced locally with a Swift Foundation launcher. Applies to every Mac/iPhone game preparation, independent of the game, keys or saves. Released in 1.4.2/build 7.
